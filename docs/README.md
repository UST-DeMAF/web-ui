## Introduction

The DeMAF is a tool that enables transforming technology-specific deployment models (TSDMs) into technology-agnostic deployment models (TADM) that are modeled based on the Essential Deployment Metamodel (EDMM). Additionally, it has a built-in visualization tool for the created TADM.

## Transformation Usage

To transform a technology-specific deployment model (TSDM), its corresponding files must be uploaded, and its deployment technology must be selected.
Options relating to the visualizations can then be selected and additional commands can be transferred in the text field.
The transformation is started by clicking on the transformation button.
The current transformation is now represented in the center of the screen by a spinning gear icon.
The transformation may take some time.
After a successful transformation, a new tab is opened within the page and the visualization tool is loaded.
